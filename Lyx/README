Please note that I've given up trying to use Lyx to write ACM SIG papers; instead I've gone back to using Emacs and LaTeX directly; I don't think my sig-alternate.layout file works correctly but I'm leaving it here in case it's of use to anyone.

For usage instructions, see my blog: http://jack-kelly.com/getting_latex_and_lyx_to_use_acm_sig_class_file
